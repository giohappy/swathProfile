name=swath profile
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=Create an aggregate profile normal to a baseline 
version=0.1
author=Maximilian Krambach
email=maximilian.krambach@gmx.de
about=Generates a table with aggegates on an "averaged" swath profile along a baseline. Useful if you want a statistical profile of an entire river, or along other features. Uses the method described in Hergarten et.al. (2014) "Extracting topographic swath profiles across curved geomorphic features". Currently experimental, as the buffer creation still produces artifacts.
